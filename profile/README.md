## Welcome to the BioForest space :wave:

> The **BIOFOREST** project is an initiative of the Tropical managed Forests Observatory [(TmFO)](https://tmfo.org/) network, and is funded from 2023-2026 by the Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity [(CESAB)](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) of the French Foundation for Biodiversity Research [(FRB)](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/)

The **BIOFOREST** project aims to synthesize and analyse pan-tropical data on tree diversity and other forest recovery metrics, from over 1200 ha of permanent plots in logged tropical forests. We will also model recovery of these metrics under difference management practices and climate change scenarios.

With this research, we hope to understand, and shine light on how to better manage tropical forests for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and sustainable timber production.
 
**BIOFOREST** is led by [**Camille Piponiot-Laroche**](https://ur-forets-societes.cirad.fr/actualites/camille-piponiot-integre-l-upr-forets-et-societes) (CIRAD, France) and [**Marielos Pena-Claros**](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/marielos-pena-claros.htm) (University of Wageningen, the Netherlands), and is currently co-ordinated by [**Mithila Unkule**](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/membre/mithila-unkule/) (postdoc at FRB-CESAB, France).
